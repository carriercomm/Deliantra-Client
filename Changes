Revision history for Perl extension Deliantra::Client

0.9975 Wed Aug 27 22:16:27 CEST 2008
	- use biggest video mode <= 1024x768 by default now (previous releases had a bug
          that caused them to select the smallest vdieo mode available).
	- ported to the rather horridly broken apple os x platform,
          using macports (the only non-broken part of the whole thing).
	- clarify/fix weight/value autopickup option with a tooltip and a server change.

0.9974 Fri Aug  1 15:45:59 CEST 2008
	- implement smooth scrolling for the player.
	- try a different workaround to maybe register Deliantra::Client.
        - support switching off of alpha framebuffers, to work around
          possible fallback-to-software-renderer problems.
        - allow video modes <800x600 to be selectable.
        - decode player from map1ax.
	- made libsdl1.2.10+ a requirement.
        - improve the slider widget.
	- use AnyEvent::Socket::parse_hostport.
        - upgrade to BDB 1.7.
        - properly clear mapcells in all cases, also try a heuristic to avoid
          player ghost images.

0.9973 Mon Jul  7 09:27:59 CEST 2008
	- added a dummy "package Deliantra::Client" to bin/deliantra, as
          cpan stupidly cannot install distributions by name.
	- convert to new non-blocking API.
        - support IPv6 server connections.
        - the chat tabs now have tooltips again.

0.9972 Thu May 22 22:45:01 CEST 2008
	- save all map changes in map cache, not just the current map (this fixes
          the problem of map border "black out" in the minimap).
        - use an even more compact format for minimap data.
        - use an uncompressed cache for minimap data, increases memory requirements
          (~1mb) but saves compression.
	- close container, clear inventory, floorbox etc. to avoid a crash when
          clicking on them after logging out.
	- support xml formatting in ex replies (item tooltips, requires server
          2.54+).
	- try to ignore repeated keypress-events for movement, as
          these are usually keyrepeats.
	- added default (0) for the shift_fire_stop setting
	- write client.cf in pretty-printed-json.
        - avoid crashes if map cache is corrupted.

0.9971 Mon May  5 21:37:33 CEST 2008
	- reverse order of items in floorbox.
	- sort right side of inventory by floor order.
        - make messages window always visible.
	- fix stat tooltips by not lowercasing keywords in pod2wiki.
	- fix longstanding bug where the stats tab would be removed during chargen.
        - fix menu alignment.
	- change podwiki format to be slightly more generic.
	- ignore pseudo-items in floorbox, only show in inventory.

0.9970 Sun Mar 30 13:30:47 CEST 2008
	- fix a bug in tile id allocation, the effect of this bug
          was effectively disabling the tile cache, upgrade is highly
          recommended.
        - fix npc dialog.
	- upgrade the database schema (i.e. nuke it...).
	- only open the database before forking the bg server.
        - PRECOMPILED BINARY: use packaged libdb4.6 instead of libdb4.4.
        - use newer BDB module (might fix the filename encoding issue under win32).
        - use a real bdb sequence for the faceid, for better performance.

0.9968 Tue Mar 25 20:28:16 CET 2008
	- reduce documentation memory usage.
        - fix the stat gauge tooltips that have gone missing since 0.9966.

0.9967 Mon Mar 24 01:24:07 CET 2008
	- implement keyboard modifier display (mostly because of the numlock
          problems under windows).
        - work around a bug on windows where the layout font is being ignored.

0.9966 Sat Mar 22 14:26:05 CET 2008
	- when the message window is hidden and the input is activated, it will
          become visible again.
	- the max number of paragraphs in the chattabs were not limited,
          leading to a naughty memory leak
	- the highlighting of the chattabs were deep blue where they should have been
          deep red :-)
	- fixed a small inconvenience in the history handling of chat tab entries
          (hitting cursor-up or cursor-down won't erase what you typed by accident
          anymore).

0.9965 Sat Jan 19 05:51:39 CET 2008
	- work around a database race condition by using single-threaded
          database access.

0.9964 Fri Jan 18 06:30:13 CET 2008
        - fixed a bug where the message fontsize wasn't set correctly
        - do not call glTexSubimage2D on 0x0 bitmaps, as this
          crashes newer nvidia drivers.
        - fix chatbox label padding.
	- further rename database directory.
	- further "branding" of cfplus => deliantra.

0.9963 Sun Jan  6 18:27:02 CET 2008
	- rework of the messsage window to support 'undocked' windows.
	- ignore keyboard modifiers we are never interested in.
	- improve interactivity by using a prepare, not an idle watcher,
          for screen refreshes.
        - limit the time spent in database handling, so we refresh the screen
          even during ongoing heavy texture loading.
        - load tile map at startup, not at connect time.
        - tweak database accesses.
        - widget protocol version 2, supports ui templates.
        - increase horizontal padding for buttons a bit.
        - preallocate texture name when switching video modes and the
          texture can only be loaded in the background to avoid
          something else taking over.
        - increase padding for all text entries.
        - work around a bugfix in pango that no longer is necessary
          (but causes a bug with new pango versions, argh.)
	- use supposedly faster readonly pango functions wherever possible.
        - Canvas widget properly restores line and point widths.
        - fix padding calculation.
        - change semantics for align/valign in labels to behave like other
          alignment values.

	- changed minimum required resolution to 800x640.

          when 'only shift-up stops fire' is off.
	- do not render some glyphs twice. doh.
        - fix two problems that would cause endless
          refreshes even when idle (up to 60Hz).
        - optimise refresh strategy to not refresh more often than 60hz,
          even if it means to delay updates up to 1/60th of a second.
        - updated the dejavu fonts to version 2.22.
        - switch from Crossfire to Deliantra module.
        - switch from ~/.crossfire to ~/.deliantra,
